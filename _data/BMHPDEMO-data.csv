comp004,ATILIANO_AUZA_LEÓN.jpeg,,Atiliano Auza León,image/jpeg,"Born in the historic city of Sucre, Bolivia, in 1928, composer, violinist, and musicologist Auza Leon began his musical studies at the Academy of Music of the Philharmonic Society of Sucre at 18 in 1946. He transferred a year later (1947) to the Higher Teacher Training School of Sucre (1947-1951). In 1953, Auza Leon studied composition at the National Conservatory of Music in La Paz with exiled Jewish German maestro Eric Eisner, the founder and first director of the National Symphony Orchestra of Bolivia. In 1965, he studied at the Latin American Center for Higher Musical Studies (CLAEM), a program developed in partnership with the Torcuato Di Tella Institute and the Rockefeller Foundation in Buenos Aires, Argentina, under the direction of the Argentine composer Alberto Ginastera. Upon his return to Bolivia in the 1970s, Auza Leon taught at various institutions, including the Simón Bolívar Higher Teacher Training School of Music in La Paz, where he directed the choir, and at the National Conservatory of Music of La Paz, where he taught composition.                                                                                                                                                            Throughout his lifetime Auza Leon has written numerous compositions for violin, choir, and orchestra, including ""Ramillete Sonoro"" (1958) in three volumes, a collection of Bolivian songs for children; ""Sies danzas Bolivianas del Ciclo 'Runas'"" (Six Bolivian dances of the ""Runas"" cycle) (1960) which features popular songs ""El panuelo"" and ""A la cueca""; the piano sonatas ""Anfiblástula"" (1965) and ""Los Chunchos"" (1979); and ""La Cantata Oda a Moto Méndez"" (1984) an ode to Bolivian freedom fighter Eustaquio ""Moto"" Méndez. Most notably, he wrote the music for the first Bolivian Opera, ""Incallajta"" (1980), which narrates the impossible love story between an Incan princess and a warrior. His latest compositions, ""Melodías Nacionales para Piano"" (National Melodies for Piano)(1999); ""Danzas Bolivianas para Violín y Piano"" (Ciclo Runas 2°) (Bolivian Dances for Violin and Piano (Runas 2° Cycle)) (2000); and ""Sinfonía Boliviana"" (Bolivian Symphony)(2006) in four movements demonstrate his dedication to Bolivian music. In addition to his musical work, Auza Leon has written several Bolivian music history books and published articles in the National Press. His most important works include Dinámica Musical en Bolivia (Musical Dynamics in Bolivia) (1967), Musica Contemporanea (Contemporary Music) (1976), and Historia de la Música Boliviana (History of Bolivian Music) (1985), which three sold-out editions.",n/a,,1928,,,Atiliano Auza León,"Sucre, Bolivia",-19.019585,-65.261963,,,,,,,"Educational use includes non-commercial use of text and images in materials for teaching and research purposes.

When she was four years old, she started taking piano lessons, and when she was nine, she began to study music at the National Conservatory of Bolivia. In 1990, at 18, Velasco decided to pursue a degree in architecture and, after graduation, worked in this field. Eight years later, in 1998, she returned to her music studies with her mentors, Maestro Javier Parrado and Maestra Mariana Alandia. In 2006, she began to pursue a bachelor’s degree in composition at the Loyola University of Bolivia in La Paz with Gastón Arce. Her return to music led Velasco to perform with the National Symphony Orchestra, Bolivian Choral Society, and the Philarmonic de La Paz from 2001 to 2017. She also participated in projects such as the “Trio ‘Abismos’” a horn, piano, and cello ensemble as a pianist and composer, and the fusion project “Mústika.” Between 1990 and 2013, Velasco taught at the National Music Conservatory in La Paz, where she was appointed academic director.                                                                                           Velasco's composition premiered at the Contemporary Music Journey in Cochabamba in 2006. In 2014, “Stockholm Saxophone Quartet,” a Swedish saxophone quartet dedicated to playing contemporary music, commissioned a composition from her to add to their repertoire. The song she composed was performed in various concerts in North Europe and Africa. In 2020, the quartet requested a new composition for a children’s choir and saxophone quartet, entitled “Pachamama,” which premiered in April 2021 in Sweden. In addition to being a composer, Velasco is also a prolific music arranger.

Velasco's trajectory as an arranger led her to work with the Colombian electronic experimental musical group Ambivalencias in 2014, with the Bolivian rock metal group Armadura and the National Symphony Orchestra. She also worked on the translation and arrangements for the Soda Stereo Unplugged along with the group Ruido Blanco in 2015.
